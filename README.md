# Conversational Recommendation Systems – Interactive Study Hub  
A fully dynamic **single-page HTML website** that provides a complete, multi-view learning environment for studying **Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS)** — including Mega Notes, Lecture Notes, Cheat Sheet, Slide Deck, and Mindmap.

Built from scratch based on a comprehensive academic tutorial, this website combines rich conceptual explanations, equations, models, NLU/NLG, KG reasoning, RL policies, datasets, evaluation metrics, and production-level insights.

This repository contains everything in **one single file (`index.html`)**, making it easy to host, clone, fork, and extend.
